        <p>Neon installations have played a transformative role in urban environments, blending elements of art, architecture, and commercial signage to create immersive visual experiences. Emerging in the early 20th century, neon lighting quickly became a defining feature of cityscapes, particularly in metropolises like Tokyo, Las Vegas, and Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>Artists and designers have embraced neon as a medium for conceptual and experiential works. Figures such as Dan Flavin and Tracey Emin have used neon in fine art, while urban interventions and large-scale installations have explored themes of consumer culture, nostalgia, and the interplay between artificial and natural light.</p>
        <p>Neon installations often redefine how people interact with public spaces, creating surreal and atmospheric environments. They can transform an ordinary street into a dynamic, dreamlike setting, influencing movement and perception. In addition to art, neon has also been utilized in architectural projects, enhancing facades, interiors, and public landmarks with vibrant, luminous compositions.</p>
        <p>While traditional neon lighting has declined due to the rise of LED technology, its cultural and aesthetic impact remains significant. Many artists and preservationists continue to champion neonâ€™s unique qualities, ensuring its place in both historical and contemporary design. Today, neon installations bridge the gap between vintage charm and futuristic urban aesthetics, maintaining their role as a vital element in visual culture.</p>
