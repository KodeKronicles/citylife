        <p>The Line is an audacious urban project within Saudi Arabiaâ€™s NEOM initiative, a planned city that seeks to redefine urban development. Unlike conventional cities that sprawl outward, The Line is a linear metropolis stretching 170 kilometers, designed to house up to 9 million people in an ultra-dense yet highly sustainable environment.</p>
        <p>The concept behind The Line is to eliminate car dependency, creating a walkable city where all essential services are accessible within five minutes. Transportation will be handled by high-speed rail running the entire length of the city, promising travel times of just 20 minutes from end to end.</p>
        <p>The project incorporates cutting-edge sustainability measures, including 100% renewable energy sources, smart infrastructure, and AI-driven urban planning. It also claims to preserve 95% of the surrounding natural environment by concentrating development into a narrow footprint.</p>
        <p>Despite its futuristic vision, The Line has sparked debates over its feasibility, environmental impact, and socio-political implications. While some view it as a model for sustainable living, others question its scalability and the challenges of implementing such a radical urban format. Regardless of its outcome, The Line is pushing the boundaries of how cities of the future might function.</p>
