        <p>Wrapped Reichstag was a monumental art installation by the renowned artist duo Christo and Jeanne-Claude, completed in 1995. The project involved covering Berlin’s historic Reichstag building in 100,000 square meters of silver fabric, secured by 15 kilometers of blue rope.</p>
        <p>The installation transformed the Reichstag into a shimmering, ephemeral structure, altering its presence and inviting the public to engage with it in a new way. The project was not merely aesthetic; it symbolized political change, reflecting Germany’s reunification and the evolving role of its democratic institutions.</p>
        <p>As with many of Christo and Jeanne-Claude’s works, Wrapped Reichstag was temporary, lasting just two weeks. However, its impact was profound, drawing millions of visitors and sparking discussions about history, transformation, and the relationship between architecture and art.</p>
        <p>Today, Wrapped Reichstag is remembered as one of the most significant site-specific artworks of the 20th century, demonstrating how art can engage with public space, history, and collective memory in powerful and unexpected ways.</p>
