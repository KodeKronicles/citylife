        <p>Gordon Matta-Clark’s Building Cuts represent one of the most radical architectural interventions of the 20th century. These projects, carried out in the 1970s, involved physically cutting and removing sections of abandoned buildings, revealing their inner frameworks in ways that questioned the stability and permanence of architecture.</p>
        <p>Matta-Clark’s work was not just an aesthetic exercise but a critique of urban decay, gentrification, and property speculation. By slicing through buildings, he made visible the hidden structures and history embedded within them. His approach transformed ordinary architecture into a sculptural and conceptual medium, challenging conventional ideas about space and function.</p>
        <p>One of his most famous works, "Splitting," involved cutting a suburban house in two, creating a surreal visual effect where light and air penetrated the structure in unexpected ways. Other notable projects, such as "Conical Intersect," executed in Paris, directly engaged with urban renewal and demolition, turning destruction into artistic commentary.</p>
        <p>Matta-Clark’s legacy continues to influence contemporary artists, architects, and urban theorists. His work raises questions about the impermanence of buildings, the social implications of architectural change, and the ways in which we inhabit urban environments. In a time when cities are undergoing rapid transformation, his interventions remain a powerful reminder of architecture’s role in shaping societal narratives.</p>
        <p>Today, elements of his approach can be seen in adaptive reuse projects, urban art installations, and spatial deconstruction theories. His work remains an essential reference for those exploring the boundaries between architecture, sculpture, and social critique.</p>
