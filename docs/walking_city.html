        <p>Walking City was a speculative urban concept created by the radical architecture group Archigram in the 1960s. It envisioned a future where cities were no longer fixed in one place but instead became nomadic, self-sufficient structures capable of moving across landscapes as needed.</p>
        <p>The Walking City was imagined as a cluster of massive, mobile megastructures equipped with autonomous energy systems, self-repairing technologies, and modular living spaces. Inspired by cybernetics and the increasing mechanization of society, the idea proposed that future urban environments could be adaptable and responsive rather than static and permanent.</p>
        <p>Although never intended for actual construction, Walking City challenged traditional notions of architecture and urbanism. It anticipated later discussions about flexible urbanism, megastructures, and mobile infrastructure solutions for climate change and resource scarcity.</p>
        <p>Elements of the Walking Cityâ€™s vision can be seen in contemporary research on deployable habitats, floating cities, and dynamic urban planning models. While the idea of fully mobile cities remains speculative, its themes continue to influence architectural theory and experimental design.</p>
