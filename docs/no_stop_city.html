        <p>No-Stop City, envisioned by the radical Italian architectural group Archizoom in the 1960s, was a provocative response to modern urbanism and capitalist-driven spatial organization. Instead of structured, hierarchical city planning, No-Stop City proposed a continuous, undifferentiated urban field where traditional distinctions between private and public, work and leisure, and nature and architecture disappeared.</p>
        <p>The concept rejected the idea of monumental, identity-driven cities, instead presenting an endless grid of production and consumption, where urban life extended infinitely without a clear center or periphery. This vision was inspired by mass consumerism, industrial landscapes, and a critique of the rigidity of modernist planning, particularly the rationalist ideals of figures like Le Corbusier.</p>
        <p>While No-Stop City was never intended to be built, its theoretical implications influenced later discussions on urban sprawl, megastructures, and flexible urbanism. Elements of this concept resonate in contemporary discourse surrounding decentralized smart cities, adaptable architectural environments, and the digitalization of urban experiences.</p>
        <p>By blurring the boundaries of architecture and infrastructure, No-Stop City remains a key reference in speculative urbanism, challenging us to reconsider the very nature of cities and their evolving relationship with technology and global economies.</p>
