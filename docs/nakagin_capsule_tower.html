        <p>The Nakagin Capsule Tower, completed in 1972 in Tokyo, was one of the most famous examples of Metabolist architecture, a post-war movement that envisioned cities as dynamic, adaptable structures. Designed by architect Kisho Kurokawa, the tower consisted of two interconnected concrete cores supporting 140 modular capsules, each serving as a compact living or working space.</p>
        <p>The capsules, measuring just 10 square meters, were prefabricated and attached to the central structure using only four bolts, making them theoretically replaceable. This innovative approach was meant to allow individual units to be removed and upgraded over time, reflecting the Metabolist vision of a constantly evolving urban landscape.</p>
        <p>Despite its groundbreaking design, the tower faced significant challenges. Maintenance issues, lack of renovations, and changing lifestyle expectations made the compact capsules increasingly impractical for modern living. Over time, many units fell into disrepair, and efforts to preserve the building were ultimately unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>In 2022, the Nakagin Capsule Tower was dismantled, marking the end of an era in experimental architecture. However, some capsules were salvaged and repurposed for exhibitions and research, ensuring that Kurokawaâ€™s vision remains part of the architectural discourse. The Nakagin Capsule Tower continues to inspire architects and urbanists exploring modular, sustainable, and adaptable housing solutions for the future.</p>
