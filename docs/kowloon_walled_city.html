        <p>Kowloon Walled City was one of the most densely populated places in history. Located in Hong Kong, this informal settlement housed over 33,000 residents within a mere 2.7 hectares, creating a labyrinthine network of interconnected buildings, alleyways, and structures that defied conventional urban planning.</p>
        <p>Originally a Chinese military outpost, the Walled City became a lawless enclave throughout the 20th century, with little oversight from the British and Hong Kong governments. It evolved into a self-sustaining microcosm, with thousands of businesses, unlicensed doctors, makeshift factories, and secret passageways stacked upon one another.</p>
        <p>Despite its reputation for poor living conditions and overcrowding, residents adapted to the extreme density by fostering strong community bonds. Local businesses thrived, and an informal governance system emerged within the chaos.</p>
        <p>In 1993, the Hong Kong government demolished Kowloon Walled City, replacing it with a park that now commemorates its unique history. Today, it remains a symbol of organic urban development, studied by architects and urban planners interested in alternative forms of self-organized spaces.</p>
