        <p>Plan Voisin was one of Le Corbusier’s most controversial urban proposals, formulated in 1925 as a radical vision for modernizing the city of Paris. His plan called for demolishing a vast section of the historic Right Bank and replacing it with a grid of identical 60-story skyscrapers surrounded by green spaces and wide roads.</p>
        <p>Le Corbusier’s vision was deeply rooted in his modernist principles, particularly the idea of rational, functional city planning. He believed that the chaotic, overcrowded medieval streets of Paris were inefficient and unhygienic, arguing that a city designed according to modernist ideals would improve living conditions and economic productivity.</p>
        <p>The plan was heavily criticized for its disregard of cultural heritage and its authoritarian approach to urban renewal. Many saw it as a dystopian vision that prioritized efficiency over human-scale urban life. The proposal was never realized, but it influenced later large-scale modernist developments, including post-war housing projects and urban renewal initiatives in cities worldwide.</p>
        <p>Today, Plan Voisin remains an important case study in architectural history, illustrating the tensions between utopian idealism and the preservation of historical identity in urban development.</p>
