    "mediumInfo": "Arcosanti, founded by Paolo Soleri, is an ongoing architectural experiment that aims to integrate urban planning with ecological principles, promoting sustainable living.",
    "longInfo": "Arcosanti is one of the few realized examples of an experimental utopian city. Designed by architect Paolo Soleri, it was intended to demonstrate the concept of 'arcology'\u2014a fusion of architecture and ecology. Built with a minimal environmental footprint, the community relies on passive solar energy, efficient land use, and integrated agriculture. The city remains a work in progress, serving as both a living laboratory and a model for sustainable urban design. Although it has never reached the scale Soleri envisioned, it continues to attract architects, urban planners, and sustainability advocates interested in alternative models for future cities."
