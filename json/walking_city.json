    "shortInfo": "A visionary concept of mobile, self-sustaining cities capable of adapting to different environments.",
    "mediumInfo": "Designed by the avant-garde British architectural group Archigram, Walking City was a radical departure from traditional urban planning. It imagined cities as mobile, intelligent structures that could migrate to different locations based on human needs, environmental conditions, or geopolitical shifts. Resembling massive robotic exoskeletons, these autonomous city units would be entirely self-sustaining, integrating housing, industry, and infrastructure into a singular, transportable entity. The idea was inspired by futuristic technology and the increasing mobility of society in the mid-20th century.",
    "longInfo": "Archigram's Walking City was conceived in the 1960s as a speculative response to rigid, centralized urban planning. The group envisioned a future where cities were not permanent fixtures of the landscape but adaptable and nomadic. The concept was heavily influenced by cybernetics, space exploration, and pop culture, drawing from the aesthetics of science fiction and military engineering. Each Walking City unit was imagined as an enormous, insect-like structure equipped with artificial intelligence, allowing it to autonomously navigate terrain and respond to human needs. It was also designed to be modular, meaning units could connect to form larger urban formations or detach to move independently. Though never realized, Walking City challenged contemporary architects to rethink the static nature of built environments and foreshadowed concepts of smart cities and adaptive architecture."
