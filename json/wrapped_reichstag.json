    "mediumInfo": "Christo and Jeanne-Claude\u2019s Wrapped Reichstag was an artistic intervention that transformed one of Germany\u2019s most symbolic political buildings into a temporary work of art. The massive structure was completely enveloped in silver fabric, forcing viewers to see it in a new way and raising questions about transparency, history, and national identity.",
    "longInfo": "In 1995, artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude wrapped Berlin\u2019s Reichstag in over 100,000 square meters of silver fabric, held in place by miles of blue rope. This project, decades in the making, was a profound commentary on the fluid nature of history, politics, and architecture. The Reichstag, once a symbol of German power and destruction, was momentarily stripped of its recognizable features, inviting viewers to reimagine its significance. While temporary, the installation was a powerful reminder of how political and national identities evolve over time."
