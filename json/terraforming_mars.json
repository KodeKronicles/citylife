    "mediumInfo": "Terraforming Mars involves developing self-sustaining human settlements on the Red Planet. Architects and scientists are exploring domed cities, underground habitats, and bioengineered environments that could support long-term habitation.",
    "longInfo": "Mars colonization has long been a staple of science fiction, but recent advances in technology have made it a serious subject of study. Proposed settlements include domed biospheres, underground cities protected from radiation, and 3D-printed habitats built using Martian soil. NASA, SpaceX, and private research groups are actively developing plans for self-sufficient cities that can generate their own air, water, and food. While Mars presents extreme challenges, successful colonization could mark the first step in humanity becoming an interplanetary species."
