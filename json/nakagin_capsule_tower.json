    "mediumInfo": "The Nakagin Capsule Tower was an architectural experiment that embodied Japan\u2019s Metabolist movement. Designed by Kisho Kurokawa, it consisted of small, prefabricated living capsules that could be detached and replaced as needed. The concept was aimed at creating a flexible, adaptable urban housing system that reflected the rapid changes of modern life. Each capsule was a self-contained micro-apartment, featuring built-in furniture and compact amenities, making it ideal for businessmen and transient urban dwellers.",
    "longInfo": "Built in 1972, the Nakagin Capsule Tower in Tokyo was one of the most recognizable examples of Metabolist architecture, a movement that sought to create buildings that could organically grow and change over time. The tower consisted of 140 prefabricated capsules attached to a central core, designed to be replaced or updated as needed. The capsules measured just 10 square meters, each equipped with built-in furniture, a compact bathroom, and minimal kitchen facilities. The project reflected post-war Japan\u2019s fascination with modularity, high-density urbanism, and technological progress. However, the replacement mechanism was never fully realized, and over time, the building fell into disrepair. Despite efforts to preserve it, the tower was eventually demolished in 2022, marking the end of one of architecture\u2019s most ambitious housing experiments. Its legacy continues to influence discussions on modular construction and sustainable urban living."
