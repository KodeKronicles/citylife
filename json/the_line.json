    "shortInfo": "A controversial, 170km-long linear city designed to house 9 million people.",
    "mediumInfo": "The Line is a futuristic urban megaproject in Saudi Arabia, promising a zero-carbon, car-free city built in a single continuous line stretching across the desert. Its design challenges traditional city layouts by eliminating roads and centralizing all services within a narrow, high-density corridor.",
    "longInfo": "The Line is part of Saudi Arabia\u2019s NEOM initiative, an ambitious attempt to build an entirely new urban model. The proposed city is a 170km-long, 500m-high mirrored wall enclosing a densely populated corridor. Inside, everything is within a five-minute walk, with high-speed transport replacing traditional road networks. The project has sparked global debate, with critics questioning its feasibility, ecological impact, and human rights implications. If completed, The Line could redefine urban planning\u2014or become a cautionary tale of over-ambitious urbanism."
