    "longInfo": "Since the 1970s, artist James Turrell has been transforming the Roden Crater, an extinct volcano in the Arizona desert, into a monumental observatory dedicated to the perception of light and space. The project consists of a series of precisely carved tunnels and chambers designed to manipulate natural light, allowing visitors to witness astronomical phenomena in a controlled environment. Inspired by ancient observatories like Stonehenge, the Roden Crater is a fusion of art and architecture, emphasizing the ways in which light and space influence human perception."
