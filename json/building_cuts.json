    "longInfo": "Gordon Matta-Clark\u2019s Building Cuts were a form of architectural dissection, executed on abandoned buildings throughout the 1970s. His most famous interventions involved carving large sections out of structures, creating dramatic voids that allowed light to penetrate spaces in unexpected ways. These works blurred the line between sculpture, performance, and architecture, engaging with themes of urban decay, gentrification, and the ephemeral nature of built environments. Though many of the buildings were later demolished, his work remains influential in contemporary discussions on space and urbanism."
