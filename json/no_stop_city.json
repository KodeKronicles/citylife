It challenged conventional zoning and the idea of buildings as distinct objects.",
    "longInfo": "No-Stop City, conceived by the radical Italian design collective Archizoom in the 1970s, was a direct critique of capitalist urban development. It envisioned a world where architecture dissolved into an endless matrix of production and consumption, stripping away aesthetic and functional distinctions. This provocative vision was inspired by the increasing homogenization of modern urban environments, where shopping centers, office parks, and housing developments were becoming indistinguishable. By proposing a city without form, No-Stop City questioned the very necessity of architecture as an independent discipline, instead presenting urbanism as an ever-expanding system driven by commerce."
