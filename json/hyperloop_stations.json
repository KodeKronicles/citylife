    "shortInfo": "High-speed underground vacuum trains designed to reshape urban transport.",
    "mediumInfo": "Hyperloop technology, pioneered by Elon Musk, aims to revolutionize transportation by propelling passenger pods through low-pressure tubes at speeds exceeding 1,000 km/h. Its stations would be designed to integrate seamlessly with existing urban networks.",
    "longInfo": "The Hyperloop concept envisions high-speed travel between cities in pressurized tubes, drastically reducing commute times. Proposed stations would function as multi-modal transport hubs, connecting with local public transit and urban centers. The idea has faced significant technical and financial hurdles, with test projects underway but no full-scale implementation yet. If realized, Hyperloop stations could dramatically alter urban connectivity, allowing for high-speed commuting across large distances while reducing environmental impact."
