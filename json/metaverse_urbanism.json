    "mediumInfo": "Metaverse urbanism explores how digital architecture can create immersive, functional spaces that exist entirely online. These virtual cities redefine the idea of place, ownership, and interaction.",
    "longInfo": "With the rapid expansion of virtual reality and blockchain technology, metaverse urbanism is emerging as a new frontier in architectural design. Digital platforms such as Decentraland and Meta\u2019s Horizon Worlds allow users to create, buy, and sell virtual land, transforming real estate into a digital asset. Unlike physical cities, these virtual spaces are unconstrained by material limitations, allowing for experimental forms, gravity-defying structures, and algorithmically generated environments. As digital environments continue to develop, they challenge traditional notions of architecture and urban planning."
