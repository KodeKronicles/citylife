    "mediumInfo": "Dan Flavin and other artists pioneered neon light installations that blurred the boundaries between architecture and sculpture. These works turned urban environments into dynamic, glowing landscapes, manipulating space through color and illumination.",
    "longInfo": "Neon installations emerged as a major form of urban art in the 20th century, particularly through the works of Dan Flavin, Keith Sonnier, and James Turrell. These artists used neon and fluorescent lighting to challenge conventional understandings of space and perception. In cities, neon lights became synonymous with commercialism, nightlife, and spectacle. However, in an artistic context, they invited viewers to experience architecture as an evolving, luminous phenomenon. Whether through immersive environments or interventions in public space, neon installations remain an enduring symbol of how light can reshape the urban landscape."
