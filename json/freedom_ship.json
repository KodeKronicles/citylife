    "shortInfo": "A proposed floating city designed to house 100,000 residents.",
    "mediumInfo": "The Freedom Ship was an ambitious proposal for a permanently floating city, envisioned as an independent, mobile urban environment. Designed to be a self-sustaining economic hub, the ship would contain residential zones, businesses, schools, and entertainment centers, traveling the world without being bound to any country.",
    "longInfo": "The Freedom Ship concept, proposed in the 1990s, was a radical alternative to traditional urbanization. The vision was a massive, self-contained floating city, four times the length of the largest cruise ship, capable of housing 100,000 people. It would feature its own airport, hospitals, schools, and commercial districts, allowing residents to live a completely nomadic lifestyle. Despite the futuristic appeal, the project faced numerous financial and engineering challenges, and while it was never realized, it remains an example of speculative urban planning that questions the limits of territorial governance and sovereignty."
