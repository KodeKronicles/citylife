    "mediumInfo": "Mars Colony projects explore how architecture can adapt to extraterrestrial conditions, focusing on self-sustaining habitats capable of supporting human life in extreme environments.",
    "longInfo": "As technology advances, Mars colonization has shifted from science fiction to a serious area of research. Concepts for Martian cities include bio-dome structures, underground shelters, and AI-assisted infrastructure capable of sustaining human life. These projects focus on solving key challenges such as radiation exposure, resource scarcity, and closed-loop life support systems. NASA, SpaceX, and independent researchers are actively developing prototypes for self-sufficient habitats that could enable long-term human settlement beyond Earth."
