    "mediumInfo": "AI-Designed Cities use machine learning to generate urban plans based on efficiency, environmental factors, and human behavior. These computational approaches optimize traffic flow, green space distribution, and architectural layouts in ways that human planners might overlook.",
    "longInfo": "The concept of AI-designed cities represents the next frontier in urban planning. By feeding vast amounts of data into machine learning algorithms, designers can generate optimized urban plans that respond to traffic patterns, environmental impact, and population density in real-time. AI can propose novel layouts for public spaces, suggest eco-friendly materials, and automate construction planning. Some experimental projects, such as those by Zaha Hadid Architects and Google\u2019s Sidewalk Labs, are already testing AI-assisted city planning. While these approaches promise greater efficiency, they also raise questions about the role of human intuition and cultural identity in shaping urban environments."
