    "shortInfo": "A radical urban plan that proposed demolishing historic Paris for modernist towers.",
    "mediumInfo": "Le Corbusier\u2019s Plan Voisin was an ambitious and controversial vision for the future of Paris. He proposed replacing much of the city\u2019s historic core with a series of uniform skyscrapers arranged in a precise grid, surrounded by open green spaces. His goal was to eliminate the chaotic medieval street patterns and create a highly efficient, functionalist urban environment. While never realized, the plan demonstrated his belief in rational urban planning and the supremacy of the modernist high-rise as a solution to urban congestion.",
    "longInfo": "In the 1920s, Le Corbusier, one of the most influential architects of the modern movement, developed Plan Voisin as a radical intervention for the city of Paris. The proposal involved demolishing a large section of the Right Bank, including the Marais district, and replacing it with a set of identical 60-story towers arranged in a symmetrical pattern. The plan emphasized efficiency, hygiene, and modernity, incorporating vast green spaces, elevated highways, and a strict separation of residential, commercial, and industrial zones. The vision was deeply influenced by his ideas of the 'Radiant City,' a utopian model where urban life would be optimized through strict zoning and standardized architectural forms. However, critics pointed out that Plan Voisin disregarded the social and historical fabric of Paris, prioritizing geometric order over human-scale urbanism. Though never implemented, the plan influenced later urban renewal projects and remains a point of debate in discussions on modernist planning and its impact on historical cities."
