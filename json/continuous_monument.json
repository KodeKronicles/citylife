    "mediumInfo": "Superstudio\u2019s Continuous Monument was a provocative critique of modernist urban planning. It imagined a future where architecture became an all-encompassing, uniform grid that spanned across continents, erasing geographical and cultural distinctions. This concept was a response to the rapid expansion of functionalist architecture and globalization, which Superstudio viewed as a homogenizing force. The reflective surfaces of the Continuous Monument symbolized a neutral, indifferent landscape that subsumed all historical, natural, and social diversity beneath it.",
    "longInfo": "The Continuous Monument was a conceptual project by the radical Italian design collective Superstudio, emerging from the countercultural movements of the late 1960s. It was conceived as both a utopian and dystopian vision, reflecting the increasing dominance of modernist ideals in architecture. The design presented an uninterrupted, gridded surface that could theoretically extend across the entire globe, covering cities, mountains, and oceans with a single architectural form. Its imposing scale and lack of differentiation acted as a critique of the uniformity imposed by International Style modernism. Superstudio\u2019s vision was not a literal proposal but rather a theoretical and artistic statement on the dangers of unchecked architectural rationalization. The project foreshadowed later debates on globalization, digital cities, and the loss of cultural specificity in contemporary urban environments."
