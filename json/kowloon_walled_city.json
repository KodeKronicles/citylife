    "shortInfo": "A hyper-dense, unregulated urban block that housed 33,000 people in just 2.7 hectares.",
    "mediumInfo": "Kowloon Walled City was an extreme example of organic, unregulated urban development. Located in Hong Kong, it grew without any formal planning or governmental oversight. Buildings were constructed haphazardly, stacked on top of each other with little regard for safety regulations. Despite its chaotic appearance, the city developed its own order, with small businesses, doctors, schools, and food vendors operating within its tight confines.",
    "longInfo": "Kowloon Walled City, often referred to as the most densely populated place on Earth, was an unplanned urban settlement in Hong Kong. Originally a Chinese military outpost, it was left in a legal limbo after British colonization. Over the decades, migrants and squatters built upon the remains, creating a densely packed maze of interconnected buildings, tunnels, and alleys. It lacked basic services like sewage or official law enforcement, yet it functioned as a self-sustaining microcosm of urban life. Despite its lawless reputation, residents formed strong communal bonds. The city was demolished in 1993, but remains an enduring symbol of alternative urbanism."
