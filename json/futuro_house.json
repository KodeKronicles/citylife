    "mediumInfo": "The Futuro House, designed by Finnish architect Matti Suuronen, was a prefabricated home meant to be easily transported and assembled. Its spaceship-like design made it an icon of 1960s futuristic optimism.",
    "longInfo": "The Futuro House was a bold experiment in prefabricated architecture, reflecting the 1960s fascination with space-age aesthetics. Built from fiberglass-reinforced plastic, the house was lightweight, portable, and capable of being placed in almost any environment. It featured a compact, efficient interior with built-in furniture and heating systems, making it ideal for temporary or remote living. However, due to high production costs and changing tastes, only a limited number were produced, and the concept never became mainstream. Today, surviving Futuro Houses are considered valuable design artifacts, reflecting a moment in history when architects and designers dreamed of a more mobile, futuristic world."
